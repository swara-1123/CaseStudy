Comprehensive Data Mapping Plan:
The data mapping plan will define how each consumer data column from ABC Utility Company's database corresponds to the fields in the SMART360 consumer table. This plan will ensure accurate and efficient transfer of information between systems.

Python Scripts for Automated Mapping:
Below are Python scripts for automating the data mapping, extraction, transformation, and loading processes. These scripts will facilitate seamless integration of consumer data into the SMART360 platform.

Documentation of Mapping Process:
The mapping process involves documenting how each consumer data column is mapped to the corresponding fields in the SMART360 consumer table. This documentation ensures clarity and consistency throughout the integration process.

Testing and Validation of Scripts:
Thorough testing and validation of the Python scripts will be conducted to ensure their functionality, accuracy, and reliability. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and validation against predefined criteria for data accuracy and completeness.
